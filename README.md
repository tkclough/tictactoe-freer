This is just a simple project so I could test out extensible effects with freer-simple. I had a lot of fun messing around
with combining effects, but I've found it tough to get the types to line up when transforming effects to monadic code.

To Do:
* Implement perfect AI player
* Add frontend using electron interfacing with servant api
